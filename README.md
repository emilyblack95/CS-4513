- Homework 2: The goal of this project was to implement a web-object relational database application that uses JSP, JDBC and Oracle 12c (object relational database system). In this project, I was given an ER diagram for a mock up of a hospital database application, and had to implement it and test the application according to the homework 2 requirements given.
